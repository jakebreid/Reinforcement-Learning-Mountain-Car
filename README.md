# Reinforcement Learning - Mountain Car!

The results of my "Mountain Car" project, highlighting how well the car learns over time using 
reinforcement learning. As you can see, the total reward increases each time, as
the # of steps it takes is equal to the reward (negative) so it gets very efficient 
at minimizing the # of steps! 

This was programmed using the Sarsa-Lambda RL algorithm, as well as a greedy-epsilon policy to ensure some level of exploration occurs.
