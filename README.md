# Reinforcement Learning - Mountain Car!

The results of my "Mountain Car" project, which highlights how well the car learns over time using 
reinforcement learning. As you can see, the total reward increases each time, as
the # of steps it takes is equal to the reward (negative) so it gets very efficent 
at minimizing the # of steps!
